========

A Unit Testing framework for Xojo.

## How to Use

Refer to the wiki for usage instructions and an example.

https://github.com/xojo/XojoUnit/wiki

## How to contribute

You can contribute to XojoUnit in two ways:

* submit changes from your Fork of XojoUnit
* request to become a Contributor

Don't send me emails with your updated changed project.

### Forking XojoUnit

1. Click the Fork button at the top.
2. Make your changes.
3. Push your changes back to GitHub.
4. Create a "Pull Request" for your changes.

These steps notify the XojoUnit maintainers so that the change can be reviewed for inclusion in XojoUnit.

Here is a helpflow Github workflow document I found:

Frankly, this is all still new to me so we'll see how it goes!

### Becoming a Contributor

If you actively submit good changes, I'll probably make you a Contributor so that I don't have to process all your pull requests.
